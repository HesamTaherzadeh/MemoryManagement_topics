## Introduction

Memory management is a critical aspect of C++ programming. This repository aims to deepen your understanding of advanced techniques for managing memory, including:
- Efficient allocation and deallocation.
- Using smart pointers to manage object lifetimes.
- Avoiding memory leaks and undefined behavior.
- Exploring custom memory management strategies.

The examples provided are intended to serve as building blocks for more complex applications.

## Examples

### 1. Custom Deleters with `std::unique_ptr`

#### Description

This example demonstrates how to use `std::unique_ptr` with custom deleters to manage memory allocated with `malloc` and constructed using placement new. The use of a custom deleter ensures that the destructor is called, and memory is properly deallocated, avoiding potential leaks.

#### Reference

See the code in [`custom_deleters.cpp`](./custom_deleters.cpp).

---

### 2. Avoiding Circular References with `std::weak_ptr`

#### Description

This example addresses the issue of circular references when using `std::shared_ptr`. By using `std::weak_ptr`, the code avoids memory leaks caused by circular dependencies. It also demonstrates the use of `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership of objects.

#### Reference

See the code in [`circular_references.cpp`](./circular_references.cpp).

## Upcoming Topics

Here are some topics planned for future updates to this repository:
- **Custom Memory Allocators**: Implementing custom memory allocation strategies for performance-critical applications.
- **Pool Allocators**: Managing objects in pools for frequent allocations and deallocations.
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: Best practices for resource management using RAII patterns.
- **Garbage Collection Techniques**: Simulating garbage collection in C++ for complex memory management scenarios.
- **Analyzing Memory Usage**: Tools and techniques for profiling and debugging memory usage in C++ applications.
- **Thread-Safe Memory Management**: Strategies for managing memory safely in multithreaded applications.
